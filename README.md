# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
Sprint Review and Retrospective: SNHU Travel Project
This repository contains the Sprint Review and Retrospective for the SNHU Travel project, where we applied Scrum Agile practices to guide the development process. Our team used flexible, iterative methods to incorporate feedback and ensure the project met client expectations.

Reflection on Agile and Scrum Practices
Understanding user needs is at the core of successful software development. For the SNHU Travel project, we engaged with focus groups and relied on their feedback to refine our features. Creating user stories was an essential part of this process. By breaking down user needs into manageable tasks, we were able to prioritize the most valuable features, focusing on user navigation and interface improvements. User stories helped us keep development organized and focused, ensuring we built features that truly benefited the end users.

Approach to Developing Programs and Future Agile Practices
Developing programs through an Agile approach allows for flexibility and continuous improvement. In the SNHU Travel project, we didn't follow traditional daily stand-ups or Scrum tools like JIRA, but we maintained regular communication through email and implemented feedback in iterations. Moving forward, I plan to incorporate more structured Agile practices, like regular stand-ups and retrospective meetings, to improve transparency and communication. The flexibility of Agile was critical in responding to evolving user feedback, and I aim to continue using these iterative processes in future projects to stay adaptable and user-focused.

Being a Good Team Member in Software Development
A good team member in software development is someone who communicates clearly, supports the team, and stays adaptable. During the SNHU Travel project, I balanced my roles as the Product Owner and Tester, ensuring feedback was communicated to the developers and bugs were addressed early. By collaborating across roles and keeping the team aligned with the project’s goals, we were able to maintain momentum even when changes arose. In future development work, I’ll continue fostering open communication and collaboration to contribute to a productive team environment.
